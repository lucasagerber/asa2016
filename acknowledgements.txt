I am grateful for the guidance of my advisors Ruth Horowitz and Kathleen Gerson who oversaw this project.  I also thank those who contributed comments to this project, including Steven Lukes, Ailsa Craig, and Phillipa Chong.  This paper was written through a generous scholarship from New York University's B.A./M.A. program.  Lastly, I am indebted most of all to my family and friends without whom this manuscript would have been impossibly meaningless.
