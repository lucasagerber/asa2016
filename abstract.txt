Sociologists and gender theorists describe the institutional processes through which literary critics have historically excluded female authors from the canon.  I contribute here to the literature on the evaluative strategies practiced on male versus female authors with a comparative lens toward the reviewers.  This study examines how reviewers, in the context of poetry book reviews, use authors' genders as tools for constructing the value of those authors' poetry.  Based on a textual analysis of 231 poetry book reviews published in 9 well-known literary magazines across the United States, I investigate two distinct practices reviewers use to consecrate male versus female poets, stratifying by the genders of the reviewers and contextualizing evaluations within the mechanics of the review processes.  I assess (1) how reviewers compare authors to poets in the literary canon, and (2) how reviewers mark authors' genders in their reviews to constitute the value of the work.  I conclude that these strategies simultaneously valorize and compartmentalize female poets as distinct from male poets.  Even while female reviewers, more so than male reviewers, deploy distinct evaluative practices to value female authors, the evaluative practices which link male authors to values unavailable to female authors remain unchallenged by all reviewers.
