The "imagined networks" drawn by poetry book reviewers between authors and canonical poets are highly gendered.  I found three important tendencies among reviewers.
  
  
(1) Fewer Comparisons for Female Authors.
  
Male reviewers generate more comparisons between male authors and canonical poets than female authors and canonical poets while female reviewers are more balanced.
  
  
(2) Male Authors Compared to Male Poets.
  
Among the comparisons to canonical poets, all reviewers almost exclusively compare male authors to male canonical poets and not female canonical poets.
  
  
(3) Female Authors Compared to Female Poets.
  
Among the comparisons to canonical poets, all reviewers compare female authors to female canonical poets more often than they do for male authors, and this is most pronounced with female reviewers.
  
  
Male authors remain almost exclusively connected to male canonical poets, which reinforces groupings of works based on gender.  Even while female reviewers are more balanced in their use of comparisons to canonical poets to female authors, both female and male reviewers deploy gendered comparisons to male authors, almost exclusively relating male authors to male canonical poets.
